# GitHub Profile Recreation
#### (4.4.github-profile)

This project is from the end of week 4 at [The Iron Yard Greenville](https://theironyard.com). The learning goal was to reinforce Handlebars templating using real data from GitHub's API. The repo list and user information are script templates in the markup. The development of this project required a private API key to indicate to the endpoint that all the traffic was not malicious. The deployed version uses the public API.

The tooling in week 4 was more advanced than previous weeks. A Yeoman generator script had been introduced as a way to quickly scaffold and install dependencies needed for each project going forward.
